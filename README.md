# Advanced Databases and Microservices â€“ Practices Overview

This repository contains the solutions and documentation for three major practices covering microservices, relational and NoSQL databases, query optimization, and transaction management. Each practice focuses on practical applications of core database and systems engineering concepts.

## ðŸ¥‡ Practice 1: Microservices â€“ REST API in Containers

**Objective:**  
To design, implement, and deploy a microservice-based application using RESTful APIs, containerized with Docker.

**Key Topics Covered:**
- REST API development
- HTTP methods and resource modeling
- Containerization using Docker
- Inter-service communication
- API testing and error handling
- Deployment practices in containerized environments

---

## ðŸ¥ˆ Practice 2: Advanced Concepts in Relational Databases and Query Optimization

**Objective:**  
To explore the advanced features provided by a relational DBMS (PostgreSQL) and improve the performance of SQL queries through analysis and restructuring.

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Design and implementation of stored functions and procedures
- Effective use of triggers to automate database behavior
- Use of PostgreSQLâ€™s query planner to analyze query costs
- Index identification and creation for performance improvement
- Comparative evaluation of query alternatives (reordering joins, using UNION, EXCEPT, etc.)
- Studying the effect of statistics generation
- Database interaction via Python using SQLAlchemy (querying and updating)

**Tech Stack:**
- PostgreSQL
- SQL (DDL, DML, triggers, functions)
- SQLAlchemy (Python DB interface)

## ðŸ¥‰ Practice 3: NoSQL Databases and Transactions

**Objective:**  
To understand the operation, structure, and transaction handling in NoSQL databases, including document-based and graph-based models.

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Core concepts of NoSQL systems
- Data modeling and querying in **MongoDB** (document database)
- Use of **Neo4j** to manage and query graph databases
- Understanding transaction mechanisms and guarantees
- Implementation of transactions using `ROLLBACK` and `COMMIT`
- Locking mechanisms and handling of deadlocks

**Technologies Used:**
- MongoDB
- Neo4j (Cypher query language)
- Transaction control (ACID properties)

Each practice builds upon the previous to develop a comprehensive understanding of modern data management systems and scalable service design.
